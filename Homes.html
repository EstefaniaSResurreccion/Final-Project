        <h1 > Why should we be informed? </h1>
        <p > As years pass by the economy of our agriculture and fishery sector expand. Although it has yet to be on track in 
            recent years, this is due to many grounds such as the pandemic, weak export movements, unsustainable farming practices,
            and many more. Our main goal is for the general public to be informed about these kinds of social issues and on how it is important. 
            May it be for our daily lives or our future. Because by being informed we can spread awareness about it and find ways
            how we can help especially the working class in this category.
